# How to install
- Clone the repository locally
- Build the plugin with `npm run build`
- Move the **entire** plugin folder into the plugins directory of your server.
- Run the server and it'll generate a plugin-config.yaml configuration file in the plugins folder. Use this to edit configuration for the plugin. Note that all configuration changes will require a full server restart.

# If there is no plugin folder in the server directory
- Run the server for the first time and the folder will be created
